# CRAHNRouting
Thiscode was written to investigate the end-to-end performance modelling of a link using quality of service parameters; delay vs. link capacity while considering the factors of spectrum management and node mobility of two nodes in tandem representing a hop in Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc networks. We modelled spectrum management and node mobility using the pre-emptive resume priority M/G/1 queuing model and the gated node model respectively. We considered delay aware routing schemes; shortest queue and random probability routing and compared them with the analytical link-capacity for analysis. The results from this study were published.
